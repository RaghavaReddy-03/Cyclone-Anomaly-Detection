# Cyclone-Anomaly-Detection
Unsupervised cyclone trajectory anomaly detection using deep feature learning and PANDA-based scoring
This project presents an **unsupervised cyclone trajectory anomaly detection framework**
that leverages deep feature representations extracted from satellite imagery and a
PANDA-based scoring mechanism. The model is trained exclusively on normal (non-curving)
cyclone trajectories and identifies anomalous curving patterns based on deviation
in learned feature space.
